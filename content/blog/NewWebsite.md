This website is largely thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dima.maxy">Max Dima</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rat.andrei">Andrei</a>.<br>


### The Artwork
 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dima.maxy">Max Dima</a> made all the artwork, his Illustrator skills are quite remarkable. He is responsible for websites like https://online.io and a few others that are in the making. His <a href="https://www.behance.net/CoonOne?fbclid=IwAR3nLPf04fJtPq4tlRZrSiVorr2fSV0mA_zdAhE4LQzOnpB8RFpWb9B2398">behance profile</a> is also something to behold. 

### The Code
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/rat.andrei">Andrei</a> is responsible for the website it self. He is the CTO of <a href="https://get.engageapp.today/index.html">Engage</a> and works as a fullstack developer at <a href="https://around25.com/">Around25</a>. 

Thanks to these two masters, the website turned out beautifully. 

### The framework

Lastly I would like to give thanks to <a href="https://gohugo.io">Go Hugo</a> and the creators of the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/ghostwriter/">Ghostwriter theme</a>. Without them, this website would have involved a lot more work.

Love, Z.
