In today's economy it has become increasingly difficult to estimate one's worth. In [This video](https://www.twitch.tv/zzveinn) I will explore how we can estimate our salary/worth using a few basic techniques. 

When looking for a new job, you want to (summary):
# Analyze your developer level (junior/mid/senior)
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGUThGNC93I&t=646s&ab_channel=IAmTimCorey) is Tim Corey talking about how to analyze your skill level
# Analyze the market to calculate average salary for your position using the analysis of your developer level
Analyzing the market can be tricky, [here is a tool github uses](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/salary) to find average salaries in certain countries and [here is a tool called payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary) which can also be helpful.
# Create a resume that reflects your developer level and experience
[Resume.io](https://resume.io/) is a great platform to create a resume and it takes care of all the formatting for you.

Lastly, [be aware of people trying to manipulate you into working for free or without a contract.](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=signs+you+are+being+manipulated) 

DO NOT WORK WITHOUT A CONTRACT OR UPFRONT PAYMENT, even if you are new and inexperienced.
