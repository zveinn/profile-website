In today's economy it has become increasingly difficult to estimate one's worth. 
<br>In [This video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/915012024) I will explore how we can estimate our salary/worth using a few basic techniques 


<br>

# 1. Analyze your skill level
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGUThGNC93I&t=646s&ab_channel=IAmTimCorey) is Tim Corey talking about what it means to be a senior developer

<br>

# 2. Analyze the market to find your avarage salary
Analyzing the market can be tricky, [here is a tool github uses](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/salary) to find average salaries in certain countries and [here is a tool called payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary) which can also be helpful

<br>

# 3. Create a resume that reflects your experience
[Resume.io](https://resume.io/) is a decent tool for making resumes

<br>

# 4. Go get that job
  [Golang Projects](https://www.golangprojects.com/) is a great site to search for jobs and so is the [golang slack channel](https://gophers.slack.com)

<br>
<br>
<br>

Lastly, [be aware of people trying to manipulate you into working for free or without a contract](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=signs+you+are+being+manipulated)
